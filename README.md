# Bulldozer

Going over OOP (Oriented Object Programming) and doing some practice excercises to get a better understanding of the concepts.

In this mini practice, I am working with a class and understanding methods and objects.

Also trying to get a better understanding of what a constructor does, and how this leads to clean code.
